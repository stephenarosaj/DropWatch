STUFF REQUIRED FROM SPOTIFY JSON FOR FRONTEND:

tracked artists (DONE (not tested) - data comes from drops track handler response): first image, name of artist, artist_id, link
for drops (DONE (not tested) - data comes from drops handler response): first image, name of artist, name of album, album type, link, releaseDate, precision
search (done (tested manually, not systematically) - data comes from search handler response): first image, name of artist, name of album, album type, link

- need to make it so that albums stores "image, name of artist, name of album, album type, link" so that drops can return them
- need to fix trackhandler to serve [first image, name of artist, artist_id, link], not just artist_id
  // addNewAlbum - add an album and update all tables accordingly
  //   - should get called when we run checkreleases and see new releases
