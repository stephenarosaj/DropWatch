STUFF REQUIRED FROM SPOTIFY JSON FOR FRONTEND:

tracked artists (DONE (not tested) - data comes from drops track handler response): first image, name of artist, artist_id, link
for drops (NOT DONE - data comes from drops handler response): first image, name of artist, name of album, album type, link
search (done - data comes from search handler response): first image, name of artist, name of album, album type, link


UpdateHandler: should even do this????
- when adding new album, make sure only 4 entries in db at a time
	- in addNewAlbum, query artistAlbums(artist_id) -> album_id[] first
	- if album_id[].size < 4, add album
	- if album_id[].size = 4, remove oldest then add album


- need to make it so that albums stores "image, name of artist, name of album, album type, link" so that drops can return them
- need to fix trackhandler to serve [first image, name of artist, artist_id, link], not just artist_id
  // addNewAlbum - add an album and update all tables accordingly
  //   - should get called when we run checkreleases and see new releases
